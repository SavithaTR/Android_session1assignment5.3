1. Test whether two vectors are exactly equal (element by element).
vec1 = c(rownames(mtcars[1:15,]))
vec2 = c(rownames(mtcars[11:25,]))

Ans:  identical(vec1, vec2)


2. Sort the character vector in ascending order and descending order.
vec1 = c(rownames(mtcars[1:15,]))
vec2 = c(rownames(mtcars[11:25,]))

Ans: sort(vec1)
        sort(vec1, decreasing = TRUE)

3. What is the major difference between str() and paste() show an example.
     NULL and character (0) are removed by str c().
    str usage: str(object, …)
    paste usage: paste (…, sep = " ", collapse = NULL)

Examples: str(vec1, vec2)
                 paste(vec1, vec2)

4. Introduce a separator when concatenating the strings.

Ans: 
       vec1=c("my name is savitha")
        vec2=c("i'm a working professional")
